# Machine-Learning---Ng-Andrew-Course
These codes are based on Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursera:
The repository includes the following code implementations (without sklearn packages)
* [Simple linear regression](/simpleLR.py) covers both one-dimensional linear regression and multivariate linear regression

* [Regularized linear regression with cross validation](/RegularizedLinearRegression.py)

* [Logistic regression](/LogisticRegression.py)

* [Regularized Logistic regression](/RegularizedLogisticRegression.py)

* [Nueral network](/NeuralNet.py) implements a nueral network multiclass classification with one hidden layer to classify photos of numbers

* [One versus all Regularized logistic regression](/OneVsAllRegLogReg.py) requires the [display function](/DisplayImageFunction.py)
